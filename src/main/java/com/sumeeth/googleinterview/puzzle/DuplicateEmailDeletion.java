/**
 * Problem Statement â€“
 * The principal has a problem with repetitions.
 * Everytime someone sends the same email twice he becomes angry and starts yelling.
 * His personal assistant filters the mails so that all the unique mails are sent only once,
 * and if there is someone sending the same mail again and again, he deletes them.
 * Write a program which will see the list of roll numbers of the student and
 * find how many emails are to be deleted.
 * <p>
 * Sample Input:
 * 6
 * 1
 * 3
 * 3
 * 4
 * 3
 * 3
 * <p>
 * Sample Output:
 * 3
